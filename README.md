# PrimaxTeamGlow

**PrimaxTeamGlow** is a simple PaperMC plugin that highlights team members with a glow, visible only to their teammates.  
This plugin is built using the [BetterTeams](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/better-teams.17129/) API to determine teams and the [GlowingEntities](https://github.com/SkytAsul/GlowingEntities) API to apply per-player colored glowing effects.

## âœ¨ Features
- Automatically detects teammates and makes them glow for each other.
- Glow is **per-player** â€” only your teammates glow for you.
- Updates every second to ensure team changes are reflected immediately.
- Fully integrates with **BetterTeams** for team management.
- Uses **GlowingEntities** for smooth, colored glow effects without using scoreboards or packets manually.

## ðŸ›  How It Works
- Every second, the plugin checks all online players.
- If two players are in the same BetterTeams team:
  - They will glow for each other using the GlowingEntities API.
- If they are not in the same team:
  - The glow effect is removed for that viewer.
